I created a Snake Game using AI, with the help of ChatGPT. Initially, ChatGPT provided me with the basic model code for the game. This acted as the foundation, and I then customized it further according to my own requirements.

In the development process, I added several important features to make the game more engaging and interactive. For example, I included a score system so that players can track their performance while playing. Along with that, I implemented a high score feature, which records the best score achieved during the gameplay. This helps players stay motivated and aim for better results each time they play.

To improve the gameplay experience, I also developed the control system. The snake can be moved easily in all four directions—up, down, left, and right—using keyboard controls. This makes the game simple and user-friendly, just like the classic Snake games people enjoy.

Additionally, I introduced pause, resume, and restart buttons. These features allow players to take breaks without losing progress and also give them the ability to restart the game anytime they wish. With these enhancements, the game became more flexible and convenient for users.

The final output of the project is a fully working Snake Game that not only demonstrates the basic mechanics but also includes advanced features like scoring, high scores, controls, and game state management. It shows how AI can provide a starting point, and with further development, I was able to build a complete and fun project.

This project helped me improve my programming skills while also making the game enjoyable for others to play
